<p>謝益輝大佬在他的 <a href="https://yihui.org/en/2018/02/career-crisis/">這篇blog</a>提到他在職涯初期的雷貨行徑。看了一是感到安慰，二來又覺得有點難過。安慰是因為原來如此厲害之人，也是有著人性的缺點，當然他很努力也很幸運地克服過了；難過則是，我好像也有著同樣的缺點（拖延？），很多事情，常常被我的拖延跟沒有計畫搞得一蹋糊塗，但我也不知道怎麼克服。</p>
<p>簡單摘要一下覺得滿有感觸的段落：
&gt; Along with my long-time “success” came my inflated ego. Ray Dalio also mentioned this problem in “Principles”: the ego and blind spots are the two deadly flaws of most people (especially “smart people”), and it is also extremely difficult to overcome them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I haven’t had many failures in my life, and have always been surrounded by praises. This may sound great, but it created a stupid ego, and made me so afraid of failures. Whatever I do, I want to be very successful. I could not accept failures or a self that didn’t sound as perfect as described (or imagined) by other people. It would be hard to imagine three years ago that I would write such a post to describe myself as once such a terrible badass.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The ego also made me ignore people I shouldn’t have ignored. When Joe first reminded me that I should focus more on my job, I ignored him partly because I thought I was doing awesome work (secretly). That was arrogant. Joe was so much more knowledgeable and professional than me.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Now I’m ready to kill my ego. To me, the ego will grow by itself unless I intentionally suppress it. I need to control myself and try not to seek for the mental reward from praises. Ray Dalio suggests us pay close attention to what is right or wrong in other people’s comments, instead of what makes us feel good or bad. We need to be careful enough not to be trapped by the feelings produced by our “lower-level” selves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>這段大意是說，因為人生一路以來的成功，讓他產生了十分自傲的自我。這份自傲的自我，一方面讓他不知如何面對失敗；另一方面也讓他忽略別人的建議，相信自己能夠做的更好。</p>
<p>而最後在缺乏溝通跟逃避之下，當然是慘痛的教訓了。</p>
<p>我覺得在上面那段裡面，有句說得特別好，值得拿出來一提。
&gt; Ray Dalio suggests us pay close attention to what is right or wrong in other people’s comments, instead of what makes us feel good or bad.</p>
<p>這是他引用 <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%9B%B7%C2%B7%E9%81%94%E5%88%A9%E5%A5%A7">Ray Dalio</a>的話。這句話具有指導意涵，感覺也非常實用，雖然應該不好執行。雖然我也很少接收到別人對我的評論，不過面對任何意見或批評，確實應該思考那些言語「是否正確」，而不是我聽了爽不爽，這樣確實才有機會讓自己成長。</p>
<p>而這段也非常有啟發，甚至有點好笑：
&gt; Now I feel the fundamental reason why I could not stop procrastination was because procrastination didn’t really hurt (enough).</p>
<p>會痛就不敢拖延了啦XD，但我在想，除了外部強制外，不知道還有什麼方法，可以達成如此的效果。總之，雖然這篇我大量引用，有灌水之嫌，不過還是覺得，大佬願意如此分享自己拖延與逃避的經驗，看了有點感動（？）。</p>
